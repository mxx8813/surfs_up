1. Average temps in Oahu does not fluctate dramatically throughout the year.
2. Average temps in June vs December only varies about 4 degrees fahrenheit, at 75 degrees and 71 degrees respectively.
3. The min and max temperature also are similar in June and december.

## Summary

Overall, we can conclude from our findings above that the temperature trends in Oahu supports the business case for a sustainable ice cream business.  Let's nowassess whether local precipitation trends either supports this or will end up dampening the business case.

While December is cooler & wetter compared than June, neither the temperature nor precipitation trends would fluctate dramatically enough throughout the year to impact the ice cream business.  We can with confidence recommend our investor to proceed with the Oahu ice cream business based on local weather trends.
